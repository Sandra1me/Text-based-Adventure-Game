The user will move around some tiles forming a 5x5 square. For this, we have the movement arrows (up, down, left and right); the user will click each to move the character in diverse directions.

The game is to find the treasure that will appear in a random position. But some monsters will try to avoid this by attacking us as we advance. When we locate an enemy, a fight will start. If we win, the game goes on, but if we don't, the game is over. The battle is entirely luck based decided by a random number value.
